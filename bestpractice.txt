Material four : Millman and Perez

The article emphasizes the importance of good practice of computational work. It first introduces its vision for scientific software development in everyday research. Then gives specific recommendations for computational work.
I think the article is meaningful . As when I was confused about my project thesis, I would search solutions on the internet. However, the code I found usually did not work because I did not know how to use the data and which tools should I use. Therefore I think that good practice of computational work is necessary.
The article gives recommendations on each step of research work from initial exploration of ideas and data to final results(including Individual exploration,  Collaboration, Production-scale execution, Publication and Education).

But I am not familiar with some tools and process the article mentions, so I have two questions:

Q1: the article says that the Python language has a simple, expressive, and accessible syntax that emphasizes code readability. I donâ€™t know what code readability means? Whether R or other languages do well in code readability?

Q2: In the section of collaboration, the article mentions the concept of distributed version control systems (DVCS). Are Mercurial or other DVCS similar with git? Whether git is enough for us?
