Testing the number of components in a normal mixture


Question:
1.The goals is to determine the number of components in a mixture distribution.
  The metrics is the observed power of likelihood ratio tests.

2.Authors chose different mixing proportions, sample sizes, nominal levels, #components, #replications and D which measures the distance between the two components.
  According to the table1, we can find that mixing proportion did not affect the power, while other factors all affect the power.
  In the experiment, authors used 1000 samples. Maybe we can try different numbers of samples and judge whether 1000 simulations is enough.

3.Their tables are generally good. But I think it may be better if we change the place of sample size and nominal level. In this way, we can view the power varies as a =function of sample size clearer.

4.The results make sense. Because we can know relationship between the power and different  factors in the data generating mechanisms.

5.In general, 10 simulations is not enough. We can try the number of simulations vary from   1000 to 10000. if the result does not change a lot, 1000 simulations is enough, otherwise not.
